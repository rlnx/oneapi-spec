This document specifies requirements for implementations of Intel oneAPI Data Analytics Library (oneDAL).

oneDAL is a library
that helps speed up big data analysis by providing highly optimized
algorithmic building blocks for all stages of data analytics
(preprocessing, transformation, analysis, modeling, validation, and
decision making) in batch, online, and distributed processing modes of
computation. The current version of oneDAL provides
Data Parallel C++ (DPC++) API extensions to the traditional C++ interface.
