        height

    Inference
        A process of applying a :term:`trained <Training>` :term:`model` to the
        :term:`dataset` in order to predict :term:`response`

        on a new :term:`dataset`. Typically a result of a :term:`training`
        process.

|dal_short_name| terms
======================

.. glossary::
    :sorted:

    Accessor
        A |dal_short_name| concept for an object that provides access to the
        data of another object in the special :term:`data format`. It abstracts
        data access from interface of an object and provides uniform access to
        the data stored in objects of different types.

    Batch Mode
        The computation mode for an algorithm in |dal_short_name|, where all the
        data needed for computation is available at the start and fits the
        memory of the device on which the computations are performed.

    Builder
        A |dal_short_name| concept for an object that encapsulates the creation
        process of another object and enables its iterative creation.

    Contiguous data
        Data that are stored as one contiguous memory block. One of the
        characteristics of a :term:`data format`.

    Data format
        Representation of the internal structure of the data.

        **Examples:** data can be stored in array-of-structures or
        compressed-sparse-row format

    Data layout
        A characteristic of :term:`data format` which describes the
        order of elements in a :term:`contiguous data` block.

        **Example:** row-major format, where elements are stored row by row

    Data type
        An attribute of data used by a compiler to store and access them.
        Includes size in bytes, encoding principles, and available operations
        (in terms of a programming language).

        **Examples:** ``int32_t``, ``float``, ``double``

    Getter
        A method that returns the value of the private member variable.

        **Example**:

        .. code-block:: cpp

            std::int64_t get_row_count() const;


    Heterogeneous data
        Data which contain values either of different :term:`data types <Data
        type>` or different sets of operations defined on them. One of the
        characteristics of a :term:`data format`.

        **Example:** A :term:`dataset` with 100
        :term:`observations <Observation>` of three :term:`interval features <Interval
        feature>`. The first two features are of float32 :term:`data type`, while the
        third one is of float64 data type.

    Homogeneous data
        Data with values of single :term:`data type` and the same set of
        available operations defined on them. One of the characteristics of a
        :term:`data format`.

        **Example:** A :term:`dataset` with 100
        :term:`observations <Observation>` of three  :term:`interval features <Interval
        feature>`, each of type float32

    Immutability
        The object is immutable if it is not possible to change its state after
        creation.

    Metadata
        Information about logical and physical structure of an object. All
        possible combinations of metadata values present the full set of
        possible objects of a given type. Metadata do not expose information
        that is not a part of a type definition, e.g. implementation details.

        **Example:** :term:`table` object can contain three :term:`nominal features
        <Nominal feature>` with 100 :term:`observations <Observation>` (logical
        part of metadata). This object can store data as sparse csr array and
        provides direct access to them (physical part)

    Online Mode
        The computation mode for an algorithm in |dal_short_name|, where the
        data needed for computation becomes available in parts over time.

    Reference-counted object
        A copy-constructible and copy-assignable |dal_short_name| object which
        stores the number of references to the unique implementation. Both copy
        operations defined for this object are lightweight, which means that
        each time a new object is created, only the number of references is
        increased. An implementation is automatically freed when the number of
        references becomes equal to zero.

    Setter
        A method that accepts the only parameter and assigns its value to the
        private member variable.

        **Example**:

        .. code-block:: cpp

            void set_row_count(std::int64_t row_count);


    Table
        A |dal_short_name| concept for a :term:`dataset` that contains only
        numerical data, :term:`categorical <Categorical feature>` or
        :term:`continuous <Continuous feature>`. Serves as a transfer of data
        between user's application and computations inside |dal_short_name|.
        Hides details of :term:`data format` and generalizes access to the data.

    Workload
        A problem of applying a |dal_short_name| algorithm to a :term:`dataset`.
