========================
|mkl_full_name| (oneMKL)
========================

The |mkl_full_name| (oneMKL) is a computing math library of highly
optimized and extensively parallelized routines for applications that
require maximum performance. oneMKL contains the high performance
optimizations from the full Intel® Math Kernel Library for CPU
architectures (with C/Fortran programming language interfaces) and
adds to them a set of Data Parallel C++ (DPC++) programming language
interfaces for achieving performance on various CPU and Intel® GPU
architectures for certain key functionalities. The new DPC++
interfaces with optimizations for CPU and Intel® GPU architectures
have been added for key functionality in the following major areas of
computation:

- BLAS and LAPACK - dense linear algebra routine

- Sparse BLAS - sparse linear algebra routines

- Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)

- Random number generators (RNG)

- Vector Mathematics (VM) routines for optimized mathematical operations on vectors

Detailed API Descriptions
