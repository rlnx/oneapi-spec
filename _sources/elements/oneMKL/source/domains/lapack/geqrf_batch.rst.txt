      .. rubric:: Description
         :class: sectiontitle


      The routine forms the QR factorizations of a batch of general
      matrices ``A``\ :sub:`1`, ``A``\ :sub:`2`, …,
      ``A``\ :sub:`batch_size`. No pivoting is performed.


      The routine does not form the matrices ``Q``\ :sub:`i` explicitly.
      Instead, ``Q``\ :sub:`i` is represented as a product of
      ``min(mi, ni)`` elementary reflectors. Routines are provided to
      work with ``Q``\ :sub:`i` in this representation.

      .. rubric:: Input Parameters
         :class: sectiontitle


      exec_queue
         The queue where the routine should be executed.


      m
         A vector, ``m[i]`` is the number of rows of the batch matrix
         ``A``\ :sub:`i`\ ``(0≤m[i])``.


      n
         A vector, ``n[i]`` is the number of columns of the batch matrix
         ``A``\ :sub:`i`\ ``(0≤n[i])``.


      a
         A vector of buffers, ``a[i]`` stores the matrix
         ``A``\ :sub:`i`. ``a[i]`` must be of size at least
         ``lda[i]*max(1, n[i])``.


      lda
         A vector, ``lda[i]`` is the leading dimension of
         ``a[i] (m[i]≤lda[i])``.

      .. rubric:: Output Parameters
         :class: sectiontitle


      a
         Overwritten by the factorization data as follows:


         The elements on and above the diagonal of the buffer ``a[i]``
         contain the ``min(m[i],n[i])``-by-``n[i]`` upper trapezoidal
         matrix ``R``\ :sub:`i` (``R``\ :sub:`i` is upper triangular if
         ``m[i]≥n[i]``); the elements below the diagonal, with the array
         ``tau[i]``, present the orthogonal matrix ``Q``\ :sub:`i` as a
         product of ``min(m[i],n[i])`` elementary reflectors.


      tau
         Vector of buffers, where ``tau[i]`` must have size at least
         ``max(1,min(m[i], n[i]))``. Contains scalars that define
         elementary reflectors for the matrix ``Q``\ :sub:`i` in its
         decomposition in a product of elementary reflectors.


      info
         Vector of buffers containing error information.


         If ``info[i]=0``, the execution is successful.


         If ``info[i]=-k``, the ``k``-th parameter had an illegal value.
