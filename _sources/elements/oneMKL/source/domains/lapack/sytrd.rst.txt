   .. rubric:: Description
      :class: sectiontitle


   The routine reduces a real symmetric matrix ``A`` to symmetric
   tridiagonal form ``T`` by an orthogonal similarity transformation:
   ``A = Q*T*QT``. The orthogonal matrix ``Q`` is not formed explicitly
   but is represented as a product of ``n``-1 elementary reflectors.
   Routines are provided for working with ``Q`` in this representation .

   .. rubric:: Input Parameters
      :class: sectiontitle


   exec_queue
      The queue where the routine should be executed.


   upper_lower
      Must be ``uplo::upper`` or ``uplo::lower``.


      If ``upper_lower = uplo::upper``, ``a`` stores the upper
      triangular part of ``A``.


      If ``upper_lower = uplo::lower``, ``a`` stores the lower
      triangular part of ``A``.


   n
      The order of the matrices ``A``\ ``(0≤n)``.


   a
      The buffer a, size ``(lda,*)``. Contains the upper or lower
      triangle of the symmetric matrix ``A``, as specified by
      ``upper_lower``.


      The second dimension of a must be at least ``max(1,n)``.


   lda
      The leading dimension of a; at least ``max(1,n)``.


   lwork
      The size of the work buffer. Should be computed by
      `sytrd_get_lwork <sytrd_get_lwork.html>`__.

   .. rubric:: Output Parameters
      :class: sectiontitle


   a
      On exit,


      if ``upper_lower = uplo::upper``, the diagonal and first
      superdiagonal of ``A`` are overwritten by the corresponding
      elements of the tridiagonal matrix ``T``, and the elements above
      the first superdiagonal, with the buffer tau, represent the
      orthogonal matrix ``Q`` as a product of elementary reflectors;


      if ``upper_lower = uplo::lower``, the diagonal and first
      subdiagonal of ``A`` are overwritten by the corresponding elements
      of the tridiagonal matrix ``T``, and the elements below the first
      subdiagonal, with the buffer tau, represent the orthogonal matrix
      ``Q`` as a product of elementary reflectors.


   d
      Buffer containing the diagonal elements of the matrix ``T``. The
      dimension of d must be at least ``max(1, n)``.


   e
      Buffer containing the off diagonal elements of the matrix ``T``.
      The dimension of e must be at least ``max(1, n-1)``.


   tau
      Buffer, size at least ``max(1, n)``. Stores ``(n-1)`` scalars that
      define elementary reflectors in decomposition of the unitary
      matrix ``Q`` in a product of ``n-1`` elementary reflectors.
      tau\ ``(n)`` is used as workspace.


   work
      Buffer of workspace.


   info
      If info\ ``=0``, the execution is successful.


      If info\ ``=-i``, the ``i``-th parameter had an illegal value.
