   .. rubric:: Description
      :class: sectiontitle


   The ``gemm_batch`` routines perform a series of matrix-matrix operations
   with general matrices. They are similar to the gemm routine
   counterparts, but the ``gemm_batch`` routines perform matrix-matrix
   operations with groups of matrices. The groups contain matrices with
   the same parameters.


   For the group API, the operation is defined as


   ::


      offa = 0, offb = 0, offc = 0
      for i = 0 … group_count – 1
          transa, transb, m, n, k, lda, ldb, ldc, alpha, beta and group_size at position i in transa_array, transb_array, m_array, n_array, k_array, lda_array, ldb_array, ldc_array, alpha_array, beta_array and group_size_array
          sizea = transa == onemkl::transpose::N ? lda * k : lda * m;
          sizeb = transb == onemkl::transpose::N ? ldb * n : ldb * k;
          sizec = ldc * n;
          for j = 0 … group_size – 1
              A, B, and C are matrices of size sizea, sizeb and sizec at offset offa, offb and offc in a, b and c.
              C := alpha * op(A) * op(B) + beta * C
              offa += sizea, offb += sizeb, offc += sizec
          end for
      end for


   For the strided API, the operation is defined as


   ::


      for i = 0 … batch_size – 1
          A, B and C are matrices at offset i * stridea, i * strideb, i * stridec in a, b and c.
          C = alpha * op(A) * op(B) + beta * C
      end for


   where:


   -  op(X) is one of op(X) = X, or op(X) = X\ :sup:`T`, or op(X) =
      X\ :sup:`H`


   -  ``alpha`` and ``beta`` are scalars


   -  ``A``, ``B``, and ``C`` are matrices


   -  The a, b and c buffers contains all the input matrices. The stride
      between matrices is either given by the exact size of the matrix
      (for the group API) or by the stride parameter. The total number
      of matrices in a, b and c buffers is given by the 
      
      |image0| 
      
      for the
      group API or by the ``batch_size`` parameter for the strided API.


   Here, op(``A``) is ``m``\ ``x``\ ``k``, op(``B``) is
   ``k``\ ``x``\ ``n``, and ``C`` is ``m``\ ``x``\ ``n``.
