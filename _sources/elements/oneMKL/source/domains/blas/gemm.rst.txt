   .. rubric:: Description
      :class: sectiontitle


   The gemm routines compute a scalar-matrix-matrix product and add the
   result to a scalar-matrix product, with general matrices. The
   operation is defined as


  


      C <- alpha*op(A)*op(B) + beta*C


   where:


   ``op(X)`` is one of ``op(X) = X``, or ``op(X) = XT``, or
   ``op(X) = XH``,


   ``alpha`` and ``beta`` are scalars,


   ``A``, ``B`` and ``C`` are matrices:


   ``op(A)`` is an ``m``-by-``k`` matrix,


   ``op(B)`` is a ``k``-by-``n`` matrix,


   ``C`` is an ``m``-by-``n`` matrix.

   .. rubric:: Input Parameters
      :class: sectiontitle


   exec_queue
      The queue where the routine should be executed.


   transa
      Specifies the form of ``op(A)``, the transposition operation
      applied to ``A``. See
      :ref:`onemkl_datatypes`
      for more details.


   transb
      Specifies the form of ``op(B)``, the transposition operation
      applied to ``B``. See
      :ref:`onemkl_datatypes`
      for more details.


   m
      Specifies the number of rows of the matrix ``op(A)`` and of the
      matrix ``C``. The value of m must be at least zero.


   n
      Specifies the number of columns of the matrix ``op(B)`` and the
      number of columns of the matrix ``B``. The value of n must be at
      least zero.


   k
      Specifies the number of columns of the matrix ``op(A)`` and the
      number of rows of the matrix ``op(B)``. The value of k must be at
      least zero.


   alpha
      Scaling factor for the matrix-matrix product.


   a
      The buffer holding the input matrix ``A``. If ``A`` is not
      transposed, ``A`` is an ``m``-by-``k`` matrix so the array ``a``
      must have size at least ``lda``\ \*\ ``k``. If ``A`` is
      transposed, ``A`` is an ``k``-by-``m`` matrix so the array ``a``
      must have size at least ``lda``\ \*\ ``m``. See `Matrix and Vector
      Storage <../matrix-storage.html>`__ for
      more details.


   lda
      The leading dimension of ``A``. Must be at least m if ``A`` is not
      transposed, and at least k if ``A`` is transposed. It must be
      positive.


   b
      The buffer holding the input matrix ``B``. If ``B`` is not
      transposed, ``B`` is an ``k``-by-``n`` matrix so the array ``b``
      must have size at least ``ldb``\ \*\ ``n``. If ``B`` is
      transposed, ``B`` is an ``n``-by-``k`` matrix so the array ``b``
      must have size at least ``ldb``\ \*\ ``k``. See `Matrix and Vector
      Storage <../matrix-storage.html>`__ for
      more details.


   ldb
      The leading dimension of ``B``. Must be at least k if ``B`` is not
      transposed, and at least n if ``B`` is transposed. It must be
      positive.


   beta
      Scaling factor for matrix ``C``.


   c
      The buffer holding the input/output matrix ``C``. It must have a
      size of at least ldc\*n. See `Matrix and Vector
      Storage <../matrix-storage.html>`__ for
      more details.


   ldc
      The leading dimension of ``C``. It must be positive and at least
      the size of m.

   .. rubric:: Output Parameters
      :class: sectiontitle


   c
      The buffer, which is overwritten by
      ``alpha*op(A)*op(B) + beta*C``.

   .. rubric:: Notes
      :class: sectiontitle


   If ``beta`` = 0, matrix ``C`` does not need to be initialized before
   calling ``gemm``.
