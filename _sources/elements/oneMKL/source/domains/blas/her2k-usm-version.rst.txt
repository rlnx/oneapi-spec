      .. rubric:: Description
         :class: sectiontitle


      The her2k routines perform a rank-2k update of an ``n`` x ``n``
      Hermitian matrix ``C`` by general matrices ``A`` and ``B``. If
      ``trans`` = ``transpose::nontrans``. The operation is defined as


     


         C <- alpha*A*B :sup:`H` + conjg(alpha)*B*A :sup:`H` + beta*C


      where ``A`` is ``n`` x ``k`` and ``B`` is ``k`` x ``n``.


      If ``trans`` = ``transpose::conjtrans``, the operation is defined
      as:


     


         C <- alpha*B*A :sup:`H` + conjg(alpha)*A*B :sup:`H` + beta*C


      where ``A`` is ``k`` x ``n`` and ``B`` is ``n`` x ``k``.


      In both cases:


      ``alpha`` is a complex scalar and ``beta`` is a real scalar.


      ``C`` is a Hermitian matrix and ``A, B`` are general matrices.


      The inner dimension of both matrix multiplications is ``k``.

      .. rubric:: Input Parameters
         :class: sectiontitle


      exec_queue
         The queue where the routine should be executed.


      upper_lower
         Specifies whether ``A``'s data is stored in its upper or lower
         triangle. See
         :ref:`onemkl_datatypes` for
         more details.


      trans
         Specifies the operation to apply, as described above. Supported
         operations are ``transpose::nontrans`` and
         ``transpose::conjtrans``.


      n
         The number of rows and columns in ``C``. The value of ``n``
         must be at least zero.


      k
         The inner dimension of matrix multiplications. The value of
         ``k`` must be at least equal to zero.


      alpha
         Complex scaling factor for the rank-2\ ``k`` update.


      a
         Pointer to input matrix ``A``. If ``trans`` =
         ``transpose::nontrans``, ``A`` is an ``n``-by-``k`` matrix so
         the array ``a`` must have size at least ``lda``\ \*\ ``k``.
         Otherwise, ``A`` is an ``k``-by-``n`` matrix so the array ``a``
         must have size at least ``lda``\ \*\ ``n``. See `Matrix and
         Vector
         Storage <../matrix-storage.html>`__ for
         more details.


      lda
         Leading dimension of ``A``. Must be at least ``n`` if ``trans``
         = ``transpose::nontrans``, and at least ``k`` otherwise. Must
         be positive.


      beta
         Real scaling factor for matrix ``C``.


      b
         Pointer to input matrix ``B``. If ``trans`` =
         ``transpose::nontrans``, ``B`` is an ``k``-by-``n`` matrix so
         the array ``b`` must have size at least ``ldb``\ \*\ ``n``.
         Otherwise, ``B`` is an ``n``-by-``k`` matrix so the array ``b``
         must have size at least ``ldb``\ \*\ ``k``. See `Matrix and
         Vector
         Storage <../matrix-storage.html>`__ for
         more details.


      ldb
         Leading dimension of ``B``. Must be at least ``k`` if ``trans``
         = ``transpose::nontrans``, and at least ``n`` otherwise. Must
         be positive.


      c
         Pointer to input/output matrix ``C``. Must have size at least
         ``ldc``\ \*\ ``n``. See `Matrix and Vector
         Storage <../matrix-storage.html>`__ for
         more details.


      ldc
         Leading dimension of ``C``. Must be positive and at least
         ``n``.


      dependencies
         List of events to wait for before starting computation, if any.
         If omitted, defaults to no dependencies.

      c
         Pointer to the output matrix, overwritten by the updated ``C``
         matrix.
